# UnityGBLxAPI
This Unity Game Engine API asset has been created for using xAPI in products built with Unity.  It is primarily designed for K-12 games, simulations and applications that include learning content but can also be used for non-learning and non K-12 products to capture data and analytics using xAPI. The primary developer and contributor (Dig-iT! Games) uses it to capture analytics during testing and production in learning and casual entertainment games. The Beta API was developed by Dig-iT! Games through support from the National Science Foundation and Dig-iT! Games for the community.  The beta version has been updated to release 1.1.

Hundreds of user downloaded the beta version.  Input from the community allowed it to be improved to version 1.1 for a the first formal release.  DiG-iT! Games is currently using this with Unity versions 5.6.7 and 2018.4.32.  The new version includes a builder function to streamline implmentation.

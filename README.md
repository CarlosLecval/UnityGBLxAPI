# UnityGBLxAPI
This Unity Game Engine API is designed for using xAPI in products built with Unity.  It is primarily designed for K-12 games, simulations and applications that include learning content but can also be used for non-learning products to capture data and analytics using xAPI. The original developer uses it to capture analytics during testing and production in learning and casual entertainment games.

The API is currently in a controlled Beta and available to developers requesting it by joining the GBLxAPI community (https://gblxapi.org). Once you join the community the API will be provided for download. This is the initial distribution step before posting a later version in this repository.

You can read more about this new standard for collecting K-12 learning data games and apps at the community website (https://gblxapi.org) 

The initial API was developed by Dig-iT! Games through support from the National Science Foundation and Dig-iT! Games for the community.
